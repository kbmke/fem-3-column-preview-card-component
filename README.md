# 3column-preview-card
This is a challenge from frontend mentor. I did this one previously while taking the web development cohort through the YWCA. I am currently re-doing challenges to keep coding. I know that I did a few things that are not proper practice (such as using percentages and pixles) but I was more so just trying to make things work. I think that I will go back and fix things to be more proper at another time.
